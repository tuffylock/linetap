# proto-typist ([Try it out!](http://www.proto-typist.xyz))

proto-typist establishes and corrects accurate typing patterns by treating words, sentences, or lines as full units. Typos take you to the beginning of a segment instead of allowing backspace or only accounting for mistakes during accuracy calculations; bad habits are remedied, not just acknowledged. Users have control over the direction and focus of practice with options to upload personal source materials.

Features include:

- [x] Browser input compared to source material as you type, with real-time feedback
- [x] Cursor input returns to beginning of word or word group when a mistake is made
- [x] Simple upload of source material
- [x] Calculate and store WPM, accuracy, and error details
- [x] Display catalog of mistakes including their context and frequency
